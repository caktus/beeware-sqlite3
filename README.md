### Android error on MacBook Air (M1, 2020)

```
briefcase run android -d @beePhone

[hellosql] Starting emulator beePhone...
Starting emulator...
INFO    | Android emulator version 31.3.13.0 (build_id 9189900) (CL:N/A)
emulator: INFO: Found systemPath /Users/copelco/Library/Caches/org.beeware.briefcase/tools/android_sdk/system-images/android-31/default/arm64-v8a/
PANIC: Avd's CPU Architecture 'arm64' is not supported by the QEMU2 emulator on x86_64 host.

Android emulator was unable to start!

Try starting the emulator manually by running:

    $ /Users/copelco/Library/Caches/org.beeware.briefcase/tools/android_sdk/emulator/emulator @beePhone -dns-server 8.8.8.8

Resolve any problems you discover, then try running your app again. You may
find this page helpful in diagnosing emulator problems.
```

However I can manually launch another emulator just fine:

```
